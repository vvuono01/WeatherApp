# WeatherApp

This application allows the user to enter a zip code and retrieve basic weather information for that area.

## Running locally

Install Android Studio and import the project. Sync the gradle project if necessary, then hit the green run button in the upper toolbar. Select a device - if you don't have a physical Android device attached to your computer, then create a virtual device in the AVD Manager, then select that.

### Detecting devices

If you have a physical Android device connected to your computer via USB, but are not seeing it displaying, you may need to enable USB debugging. To do this, you will need to navigate to your device's developer settings, under System. If there are no developer settings, then navigate to the About section, then tap the "Build number" section 7 times. This will enable developer settings.
